## Sanity Backup and Restore Guide

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 1: Install Sanity CLI
Open your terminal and run the following command to install the Sanity CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @sanity/cli
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 2: Export Your Sanity Dataset
After installation, navigate to your project folder and run this command in the VS Code terminal:
```bash
sanity dataset export production sanity-backup.tar.gz
```
- This command will create a backup of your current dataset as a `.tar.gz` file.
- Make sure to **save your schema files** as well for a complete backup.

### ðŸŸ¢ Step 3: Import Data to a New Sanity Project
If youâ€™ve created a new project and want to import your old projectâ€™s data:

1. **Update your new project settings:**
   - Replace the new projectâ€™s **Project ID** and **API Key** with the old projectâ€™s details (if needed).

2. **Run the import command:**
```bash
sanity dataset import myData.gz production
```
- This will import your old projectâ€™s data into the new projectâ€™s dataset.
